## Old Fashioned Oatmeal Chocolate Cookies

## Ingredients

1 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature (216g)

1 cup dark brown sugar, firmly packed (200g)

½ cup sugar (100g)

2 large eggs

1 ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

2 Tablespoons maple syrup (real maple syrup or pancake syrup will work)

1 ¾ cup + 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour (230g)

1 Tablespoon cornstarch

1 teaspoon baking soda

¾ teaspoon salt

¾ teaspoon cinnamon optional

3 cups old fashioned rolled oats (285g)

2 cups chocolate chips I prefer semisweet or dark, but milk or even white chocolate chips would work, depending on your preference

## Preparation and Cooking

To make the butter, place it in a large mixing basin and beat it with an electric mixer (or a stand mixer) until creamy. Mix in the brown sugar and granulated sugar until well mixed. Stir in the eggs, vanilla extract, and maple syrup until everything is completely blended.
Combine flour, cornstarch, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate medium-sized mixing dish. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture on low speed until all ingredients are completely incorporated. Stir in the oats and chocolate chips until everything is well mixed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the cookie dough. Allow at least 30 minutes to chill1. Preheat the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius) and line cookie sheets with parchment paper. After the dough has cold, place cookie dough onto parchment paper in rounded 2 Tablespoon-sized scoops, spacing cookies at least 2" apart. Bake for 12-13 minutes at 350°F (175°C) (edges should be slightly browned, middle may still be somewhat underbaked but not raw; they'll finish baking as they cool).
